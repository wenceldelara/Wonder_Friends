# Wonder_Friends
- Here within is a wireframe prototype made in Adobe XD for our submission in the DSC Challenge

MEMBERS:
  * Cortez, Jessica Mae
  * De Lara, Wencel
  * Romero, Samantha

# How to Run
 You will need an Adobe XD software to run the file. The file is named (Phone Friend.xd)

# How to Navigate
The user must start at the very left side. That will be the opening screen of the prototyped program. It is tap triggered based to get to the main action page of the program

Once in the main action page, you will be greeted by the Phone Friend icon. Below are the 6 list of actions the user may use in the program:
 * Alarm
 * Timer
 * To Do
 * Screen Time 
 * Rewards
 * End of Day

Below the list of actions is a three dotted icon that may be clicked to reveal the 'EXIT' and 'Settings' choice. If the 'Exit' choice is selected, the program will bring the user to the very start on the far left corner. If the 'Settings' is selected the program will pop up 3 more coices; above choices for the settings are still in progress, thus will not work if selected, or it cannot be pressed at all

1. ALARM
