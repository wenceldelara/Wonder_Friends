- Here within is a wireframe prototype made in Adobe XD for our submission in the DSC Challenge

MEMBERS:
  * Cortez, Jessica Mae
  * De Lara, Wencel
  * Romero, Samantha

# How to Run
 You will need an Adobe XD software to run the file. The file is named (Phone Friend.xd)

# How to Navigate
The user must start at the very left side. That will be the opening screen of the prototyped program. It is tap triggered based to get to the main action page of the program

Once in the main action page, you will be greeted by the Phone Friend icon. Below are the 6 list of actions the user may use in the program:
 * Alarm
 * Timer
 * To Do
 * Screen Time 
 * Rewards
 * End of Day

Below the list of actions is a three dotted icon that may be clicked to reveal the 'EXIT' and 'Settings' choice. If the 'Exit' choice is selected, the program will bring the user to the very start on the far left corner. If the 'Settings' is selected the program will pop up 3 more coices; above choices for the settings are still in progress, thus will not work if selected, or it cannot be pressed at all

1. ALARM
- Once pressed you will be greeted by the 'AM' and 'PM' choices; both are same in concept but different in themes 
- After choosing one of the two you will be redirected to another page. Only the chores option can be checked.
- Time can be changed for the chores, but will not stick to the original countdown which is '10:55am'
- End result will either be greeted by a congratulatory remark or consoling words depending on the users choice.

2. TIMER
- To start user must first select a category. Timer will not work if there is no selected category
- The set timer cannot be changed and is set to '10 mins and 12 seconds'.
- If the user ends the timer before it counts down to 00:00 then the prototype will meet the user with consoling words. Else if the user continues to see it through, the program will let out a congratulatory remark

3. TO DO
- In order to tick things in the to do list, the user must click it in this order: 'Assignment > Shower >Chores'
- With each items ticked the prototype will count up for how many things are ticked in the list, and will level up anf give coins each task.
- The user may also add another to do in the list by clicking the button on the lower right side. Once clicked a winodw will pop up where the user may add items, but since this is a prototype it will not be user defined but instead the user must click the 'Title...' and 'Add Note...' to add to it. Press save once finished.

4. SCREEN TIME
- User will be greeted by the icon, by then the user may be allowed to select the number of hours to be used.
- Maximim number of hours that the prototype may coutdown is up to 5 hours
- Once choice is selected the screen time will count down til 00:00 or will be terminated if the user wishes to so while prototype is counting down.
- End result will either be greeted by a congratulatory remark or consoling words depending on the users choice.

5. REWARDS
- Opening the page will redirect the user to the number of tokens the user has collected, the shop, and the inventory.
- Only the 'shop' and 'inventory' may be clicked.
- The user may open and choose any items in the 'shop' and 'inventory'.
- Once transactions are finished in either the 'shop' or 'inventory' the user wil be brought back to the 'Rewards' page.

6. END OF DAY
- User must first choose either the 'am' or 'pm' option before the the 'set' option may be activated.
- Time may be changed after, but only the '11:00' option will run.
- Once set the icon will confirm the choice and redirect user to the next step.
- Icon will list the things the user has achieved within the userd set end of day time.
